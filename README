This is a simple Java .class to assembly decompiler and rebuilder.
Codes that use special characters (read non ASCII characters) might not be decompiled as expected, or even might not be decompiled at all.
As long as your code does not use annotations, this decompiler might work for you, but I cannot guarantee at this point. If you want to be sure that decompiling works, your code should be limited to JAVA SE 2 features.

ToDo list:
    -> Change function readAttributeInfo from classfile.c to be able to read and parse the following attributes:
         StackMapTable
         EnclosingMethod
         Signature
         SourceDebugExtension
         LocalVariableTypeTable
         RuntimeVisibleAnnotations
         RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations
         RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations
         RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations
         AnnotationDefault

    -> Add validation routines to function readInterfaces to make sure methods match the .class format specification
    -> Add validation routines to function readFields to make sure methods match the .class format specification
    -> Add validation routines to function readMethods to make sure methods match the .class format specification
    -> Add validation routines to function readAttributeInfo to make sure methods match the .class format specification
    -> Add support to UTF8 (being able to read code that uses UTF-8 chars, building methods with UTF-8 chars on their name, and pretty much everything that can use UTF-8 in a .class file)
    -> Write a Java assembly compiler (This should be done to facilitate the addition of methods and fields to the class, and also to make it easier to change current existing methods) - In Progress
    -> Document functions with examples
    -> Write a decent Makefile
    -> Write better CF_Dump* functions
    -> Write functions that return the content of structures in a easy to parse way
    -> Fix memory leaks! LEAK ALL THE MEMORIES! (not funny)
    -> Build a GUI someday? (Probably separate project)


At this point, I do not see the use for this stuff other than to teach/show about how a Virtual Machine works through examples that can be changed and tested.

This code will be used as example to an article I am writing and perhaps as my graduation project from college :)
