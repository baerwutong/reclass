The Assembler
-------------

This is the documentation describing the syntax for the rcadd assembler.

It is recommended that all assembly files written are saved with the `.jasm`
extension for easy identification.

Here you can find many examples on how to use it and all directives that
are accepted by the assembler (and the JVM opcodes as well)
